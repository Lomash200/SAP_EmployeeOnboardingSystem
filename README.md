# SAP_EmployeeOnboardingSystem
# Employee Onboarding System in Java (SAP HCM Simulation)

This project simulates an --Employee Onboarding Process-- similar to what systems like SAP HCM (Human Capital Management) provide. It demonstrates key functionalities involved in managing employee data, payroll, time management, and reporting.

The system is designed to replicate essential features of an enterprise-level onboarding system, providing insights into how employees are onboarded into an organization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

1. Main Files: Core classes for managing employee data, payroll, time management, and the onboarding process.
2. Additional Functions: Contains supplementary functionality like employee forms (e.g., adding employee details, leave forms, etc.).
3. JavaFX Files: Contains JavaFX-related files for a graphical user interface (GUI).
4. Database Queries: SQL or database-related query files for managing and interacting with the data.

## Features

- Employee Master Data Management: Replicates the process of managing employee records in an organization, including details like employee ID, name, department, and position.
- Payroll Setup: Handles payroll details such as salary, allowances, and deductions, similar to the payroll module in SAP.
- Time Management: Manages work schedules, attendance, and leave management, mimicking time-tracking features found in SAP.
- Reporting: Generates reports on employee data, payroll, and attendance for management review.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The core programming language for all backend logic.
- JavaFX: Used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the system.
- SQL: For storing and interacting with employee data and payroll information in the database.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Applied throughout to ensure modular, maintainable code.
